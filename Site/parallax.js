As such, this entire thing is not only a functional tool, but a showcase of my coding and web-design skills. I\'ve programmed everything you see in Notepad++ without the use of APIs. Everything from the parallax system to the embeds for my Tableau visualizations.

I would understand if you just closed this page now and I anticipated this kind of scope would not be accessible to everyone. My next step was to narrow my lens and use my data to hone in on specific use cases. The next graph does just that. I went and found the best computer science schools off of an official-looking website (US News Rankings. How accurate their data is, I cannot say), and filtered my original data. Like I said, I want to go into game design. If you select only the game category (Un-check "All" and check "Games"), its easy to see that I am able to eliminate some previously qualified schools from my search! This tool helped me narrow down my search to three or four specific schools I could then look into more. I find it really amazing how a tool I created shortened a five month, in-depth search process to just a few clicks.</div> </div> <div id="AS6InfoBoxTextRight"> <div>And this tool isn\'t built exclusively for my needs! Look at the graph below it. BioTech. I know absolutely nothing about BioTech, because it doesn\'t interest me in the slightest. But I know that there is someone out there who is just as energetic about BioTech as I am about Games. The same process can be applied to any category/school combination to get similar results. If anything, it is worth the five minutes it takes to fiddle with Tableau\'s crappy web interface. If you are super interested, I would recommend downloading this project and messing with it in Tableau, because it is about ten times faster. The free version of Tableau doesn\'t let me host the data on my own server, so by simply loading this page, you are running approximately 7 instances of the Tableau website right now, which is insanity and needs to be implemented better. Basically, broke high school student = slow Tableau graphs.</div> </div> </div> </div>';

By using the Google API, I was able to determine the locations for most of the schools in my database. This next graph is less of a helpful tool, and more of a display of what is possible through code! It displays all US-based schools based on location, and shows how much total funding companies that came out of those schools got.</div> <br/> <div>This was very simple to accomplish, actually. I used the Google API to search for addresses using the name of each school. I then looked through all of the companies that had related schools, and added all the funding totals together in order to get one big number for each school. Pretty simple concept with intriguing results.</div> </div> <div id="AS9InfoBoxTextRight"> <div>Accessing Google\'s API was a bit difficult, and I ran into money issues. I would love to do the same type of graph for the companies listed in my database, because that graph would be much cooler. However, the free Maps API placed a hard limit of 2,500 calls per day to the database. Fiddling with authentication and such was also a bit tricky, but nothing I hadn\'t done before (I\'d made a bot for twitter earlier in the summer). Overall, this worked well, and would work even better with higher level access to Google\'s API.</div> </div> </div> </div>';

The default setting is to display the results across all categories. This graph is interesting because it is a far more efficient way of showing which schools output companies that receive significant amounts of funding. Note that the graph is logarithmic, so the y axis doesn\'t increment evenly, but rather, exponentially. I implemented this due to a few schools dwarfing the rest (*cough* Stanford *cough*) in total funding amount. I really enjoy this graph, and the information it revealed was invaluable to me as I was deciding which schools I should apply to. </div> </div> <div id="AS11TableauWrapper"> <iframe id="AS11TableauFrame" style="border: 0px;" src="https://public.tableausoftware.com/views/ProjectCFundingOverTime/ProjectCSchoolFundingTrends?:embed=y" scrolling="no" ></iframe> </div> </div>';

Instead of totalling funding on a per-school basis, I totalled funding per-category. Graphing categories in this way makes it easy to visualize funding trends. I set Analytics, Cloud, and BigData as the defaults for this one, because all three categories are related to this project in some way. As is made clear by the visual, BigData is trending upward relative to Cloud and Analytics\' downward trends. Another of Tableau\'s shortcomings is on display here. For whatever reason, I was not able to label the trend lines, only the line graphs they are associated with. Overall, this graph is a good way to visualize the state that funding for specific categories is in. You want to go into games? Cool! The funding for games seems to be trending up. The same cannot be said for manufacturing, though. If you plan on starting a manufacturing business, make sure that you have a strong source of money before going any further. </div> </div> </div>';

Ever since I did reasonably well on the SATs, colleges had been desperately sending parcel after parcel in a vain attempt to convince me that attending their specific college was the best decision I could ever make in a million years (in reality, they just wanted my money). So...much...junk! I distinctly remember sifting through hundreds of the things, googling each and every individual school, and then thinking to myself "There has got to be a better way to do this!" I determined that I needed to examine my situation in order to improve it. I knew that I wanted my career path to revolve around video game design/development, and that eventually I wanted to pick up and start my own video game company. If I was going to attend a school, I wanted to have access to lots of startup opportunities in the gaming world.</div> <br/> <div>I busted out my Google-Fu and started looking for a solution to my dilemma. Which college best blended Computer Science and Art? Which taught the best Game Design? Which had the best entrepreneurial opportunities? All wonderful questions. My problem became that instead of finding information, I was consistently hitting a brick wall of blatant marketing. It was very difficult to pick a school that was right for me when every school I looked up told me that they were the best! The entire process was very frustrating, and after a week of drudging through the absolute ocean of potential candidates, I decided I needed a better solution. It dawned on me that I had the entire summer to develop my solution! Around that time is when it hit me - what if I looked at successful companies to determine a good school? Obviously searching for colleges was getting me absolutely nowhere. If I could determine who started those companies (Bill Gates founded Microsoft, Mark Zuckerberg founded Facebook, etc), and then look at the colleges those people attended, I would know which college best suited my needs! I had a great idea, sure, but it was no simple thing to do.</div> <br/> <div>I brought my whole scheme to my Dad during lunch one day. He reminded me of an online database named CrunchBase, containing a vast array of startup companies. Not only did CrunchBase contain the kind of information I was looking for, but it also had an API that I could use to sift through all of it. All of a sudden, my idea seemed more plausible. Not only could this project aid me in my college search, but it had the potential to assist thousands of other students and data analysts around the world with the exact same problem! That fact alone was exciting. I immediately dug into Python and began scripting. Because Crunchbase uses a REST API, all the data I queried for was returned to my script in easy-to-handle JSON format. This meant that I could process the data easily and only save bits that I wanted. I began by downloading the company master list, which</div> </div> <div id="AS14InfoBoxTextRight"> <div style="text-indent: 0px;"> yielded the name and file path of every company currently stored in the database</div> <br/> <div>As the reader, you might be asking yourself "He couldn\'t have possibly downloaded the entire database, could he?!" The answer to your question is yes, I did download every company\'s data. I had realized that my idea was ambitious before starting, but in order to achieve the highest level of accuracy that was possible for me to achieve, I wanted my data set to be as large as possible. Now, that isn\'t to say that I stored every company to my hard drive, but I wrote a script that sifted through 280,000+ companies, saving the information of ones that were relevant. The final script took over a week to run, and spit out a 150mb JSON file (Yes, megabytes) containing instance after instance of my customized company class. In fact, the output file was so large that I could not open in notepad without crashing my computer! A script that could download all of this data took countless iterations to write. There were so many points of failure where my code could break down. As time went on, I realized more and more that CrunchBase was rife with errors. Incorrect data storage, improper formatting, foreign characters, and typos plagued the data I was downloading. Eventually, my script developed an extensive error detection system that told me everything that went wrong.</div> <br/> <div>After the data eventually finished downloading, it was time to shove everything into a Tableau-workable format (easier said than done). Tableau does not natively support JSON (at least the free version), so I was required to sort my data and export into a veritable plethora of .csv files. I used paper to draw up some graphs that could prove fruitful, wrote scripts to match, and voila! My graphs were born! Obviously this process was much, much more involved than I\'ve detailed here, but I didn\'t think that spelling out all my trials and tribulations was necessary in order to show you what I\'ve done. In order to show the rest of the world my project, I had to design a web page for it. The default Tableau project showcase is utter crap. I decided to create my own! I used iframe elements to embed multiple tableau pages, which works exceedingly well. The web design was a bit hard to do, seeing as I needed to create everything from the ground up, but it looks good now, and I know which colleges I want to apply to (That was the main goal, after all).</div> <br/> <div>Fortunately (or unfortunately) I had more data that I needed. There are boundless use cases for what I\'ve done, and this page is just one example. After project C was finished, I shot off and started Project BigData, which uses the same data set but looks at trends in startups rather than the schools they\'ve come out of.

I would understand if you just closed this page now and I anticipated this kind of scope would not be accessible to everyone. My next step was to narrow my lens and use my data to hone in on specific use cases. The next graph does just that. I went and found the best computer science schools off of an official-looking website (US News Rankings. How accurate their data is, I cannot say), and filtered my original data. Like I said, I want to go into game design. If you select only the game category (Un-check "All" and check "Games"), its easy to see that I am able to eliminate some previously qualified schools from my search! This tool helped me narrow down my search to three or four specific schools I could then look into more. I find it really amazing how a tool I created shortened a five month, in-depth search process to just a few clicks.</div> </div> <div id="AS6InfoBoxTextRightS"> <div>And this tool isn\'t built exclusively for my needs! Look at the graph below it. BioTech. I know absolutely nothing about BioTech, because it doesn\'t interest me in the slightest. But I know that there is someone out there who is just as energetic about BioTech as I am about Games. The same process can be applied to any category/school combination to get similar results. If anything, it is worth the five minutes it takes to fiddle with Tableau\'s crappy web interface. If you are super interested, I would recommend downloading this project and messing with it in Tableau, because it is about ten times faster. The free version of Tableau doesn\'t let me host the data on my own server, so by simply loading this page, you are running approximately 7 instances of the Tableau website right now, which is insanity and needs to be implemented better. Basically, broke high school student = slow graphs.</div> </div> </div> </div>';

By using the Google API, I was able to determine the locations for most of the schools in my database. This next graph is less of a helpful tool, and more of a display of what is possible through code! It displays all US-based schools based on location, and shows how much total funding companies that came out of those schools got.</div> <br/> <div>This was very simple to accomplish, actually. I used the Google API to search for addresses using the name of each school.

Pretty simple concept with intriguing results.</div> </div> <div id="AS9InfoBoxTextRightS"> <div>Accessing Google\'s API was a bit difficult, and I ran into money issues. I would love to do the same type of graph for the companies listed in my database, because that graph would be much cooler. However, the free Maps API placed a hard limit of 2,500 calls per day to the database. Fiddling with authentication and such was also a bit tricky, but nothing I hadn\'t done before (I\'d made a bot for twitter earlier in the summer).

There are a few categories that work better than others. This is due to the fact that there was a lot less initial data in specific categories. The default setting is to display the results across all categories. This graph is interesting because it is a far more efficient way of showing which schools output companies that receive significant amounts of funding. Note that the graph is logarithmic, so the y axis doesn\'t increment evenly, but rather, exponentially. I implemented this due to a few schools dwarfing the rest (*cough* Stanford *cough*) in total funding amount. I really enjoy this graph, and the information it revealed was invaluable to me as I was deciding which schools I should apply to. </div> </div> <div id="AS11TableauWrapperS"> <iframe id="AS11TableauFrameS" style="border: 0px;" src="https://public.tableausoftware.com/views/ProjectC1_0_21280x/ProjectCSchoolFundingTrends?:embed=y" scrolling="no" ></iframe> </div> </div>';

Instead of totalling funding on a per-school basis, I totalled funding per-category. Graphing categories in this way makes it easy to visualize funding trends. I set Analytics, Cloud, and BigData as the defaults for this one, because all three categories are related to this project in some way. As is made clear by the visual, BigData is trending upward relative to Cloud and Analytics\' downward trends. Another of Tableau\'s shortcomings is on display here. For whatever reason, I was not able to label the trend lines, only the line graphs they are associated with. Overall, this graph is a good way to visualize the state that funding for specific categories is in. You want to go into games? Cool! The funding for games seems to be trending up. The same cannot be said for manufacturing, though. If you plan on starting a manufacturing business, make sure that you have a strong source of money before going any further. </div> </div> </div>';

				htmlCode += '<div class="ASRow14"> <div id="AS14InfoBox"> <div id="AS14InfoBoxTitle"> How Project C Came to Be </div> <div id="AS14InfoBoxTextLeftS"> <div>In the middle of June, just after school let out, I found myself staring depressingly at a colossal heap of letters. Ever since I did reasonably well on the SATs, colleges had been desperately sending parcel after parcel in a vain attempt to convince me that attending their specific college was the best decision I could ever make in a million years (in reality, they just wanted my money). So...much...junk! I distinctly remember sifting through hundreds of the things, googling each and every individual school, and then thinking to myself "There has got to be a better way to do this!" I determined that I needed to examine my situation in order to improve it. I knew that I wanted my career path to revolve around video game design/development, and that eventually I wanted to pick up and start my own video game company. If I was going to attend a school, I wanted to have access to lots of startup opportunities in the gaming world.</div> <br/> <div>I busted out my Google-Fu and started looking for a solution to my dilemma. Which college best blended Computer Science and Art? Which taught the best Game Design? Which had the best entrepreneurial opportunities? All wonderful questions. My problem became that instead of finding information, I was consistently hitting a brick wall of blatant marketing. It was very difficult to pick a school that was right for me when every school I looked up told me that they were the best! The entire process was very frustrating, and after a week of drudging through the absolute ocean of potential candidates, I decided I needed a better solution. It dawned on me that I had the entire summer to develop my solution! Around that time is when it hit me - what if I looked at successful companies to determine a good school? Obviously searching for colleges was getting me absolutely nowhere. If I could determine who started those companies (Bill Gates founded Microsoft, Mark Zuckerberg founded Facebook, etc), and then look at the colleges those people attended, I would know which college best suited my needs! I had a great idea, sure, but it was no simple thing to do.</div> <br/> <div>I brought my whole scheme to my Dad during lunch one day. He reminded me of an online database named CrunchBase, containing a vast array of startup companies. Not only did CrunchBase contain the kind of information I was looking for, but it also had an API that I could use to sift through all of it. All of a sudden, my idea seemed more plausible. Not only could this project aid me in my college search, but it had the potential to assist thousands of other students and data analysts around the world with the exact same problem! That fact alone was exciting. I immediately dug into Python and began scripting. Because Crunchbase uses a REST API, all the data I queried for was returned to my script in easy-to-handle JSON format. This meant that I could process the data easily and only save bits that I wanted. I began by downloading the company master list, which yielded the name and file path of every company currently stored in the database</div> </div> <div id="AS14InfoBoxTextRightS"> <div>As the reader, you might be asking yourself "He couldn\'t have possibly downloaded the entire database, could he?!" The answer to your question is yes, I did download every company\'s data. I had realized that my idea was ambitious before starting, but in order to achieve the highest level of accuracy that was possible for me to achieve, I wanted my data set to be as large as possible. Now, that isn\'t to say that I stored every company to my hard drive, but I wrote a script that sifted through 280,000+ companies, saving the information of ones that were relevant. The final script took over a week to run, and spit out a 150mb JSON file (Yes, megabytes) containing instance after instance of my customized company class. In fact, the output file was so large that I could not open in notepad without crashing my computer! A script that could download all of this data took countless iterations to write. There were so many points of failure where my code could break down. As time went on, I realized more and more that CrunchBase was rife with errors. Incorrect data storage, improper formatting, foreign characters, and typos plagued the data I was downloading. Eventually, my script developed an extensive error detection system that told me everything that went wrong.</div> <br/> <div>After the data eventually finished downloading, it was time to shove everything into a Tableau-workable format (easier said than done). Tableau does not natively support JSON (at least the free version), so I was required to sort my data and export into a veritable plethora of .csv files. I used paper to draw up some graphs that could prove fruitful, wrote scripts to match, and voila! My graphs were born! Obviously this process was much, much more involved than I\'ve detailed here, but I didn\'t think that spelling out all my trials and tribulations was necessary in order to show you what I\'ve done. In order to show the rest of the world my project, I had to design a web page for it. The default Tableau project showcase is utter crap. I decided to create my own! I used iframe elements to embed multiple tableau pages, which works exceedingly well. The web design was a bit hard to do, seeing as I needed to create everything from the ground up, but it looks good now, and I know which colleges I want to apply to (That was the main goal, after all).</div> <br/> <div>Fortunately (or unfortunately) I had more data that I needed. There are boundless use cases for what I\'ve done, and this page is just one example. After project C was finished, I shot off and started Project BigData, which uses the same data set but looks at trends in startups rather than the schools they\'ve come out of. It is really cool, and you can check it out <a href="http://www.lampitosgames.com/?highlight=ProjectBigData">here</a></div> </div> </div> </div> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> </div>';

It is based on the work I did for Project C (which you see and can read about <a href="http://www.lampitosgames.com/?highlight=ProjectC">here</a>). The list of companies and their classification into categories is based on a dozen published sources and rough text analytics of the Crunchbase database. Crunchbase is a curated crowed sourced database of over 285k companies.</div> <br/> <div>As for the data, there are 645 public & private companies in the data set. From Teradata and IBM to Actuate & Zoomdata. I began by harvesting data from Crunchbase by using their free API w/ Python. As of September, Crunchbase had 1250 funding events for 410 of the companies on my list. I\'ve grouped these companies into 18 categories, allowing you to compare peers as well as trends across categories. Some of the categories are broken down further. For example, the tool allows you to differentiate between cloud-based and on premise solutions or SQL vs. NoSQL databases. I gathered additional data from a variety of sources. For example, LinkedIn was used to find the number of employees.</div> <br/> <div>How does this work? Based on the information gathered, I\'ve constructed a number of interactive graphs using Tableau that enables you to slice and dice the data in interesting and informative ways. Below, you can find treemaps to compare categories, geographic maps to see where companies are located, and bubble charts (which are</div> </div> <div id="AS3InfoBoxTextRight"> <div style="text-indent: 0px;">great to see relative size of large sets), and traditional line charts to compare different aspects of the data). With most of the graphs you can interact with the results by choosing different filters (category, location, when funding occurred, etc.)</div> <br/> <div>These tools allow you to explore the data across a variety of dimensions like how has funding changed over the years, or variances in geography, category, or stage of funding. It also allows you to ask questions...Where is the new (early stage) money going today vs. 3 or 5 years ago? (answer: Today Data Driven industry solutions, 5 years ago Platforms, Analytics & Data Discovery). You can also compare fundings by category, or how one funding event compares to other funding events in the same category. How does Datastax $106M round in September 2014 compare to funding of other Data Management Platforms in 2014?</div> <br/> <div>The first graph shows 1250 funding events. Each event is represented by a circle. The size of the circle depicts the amount of funding, while the color of the circle shows the category of the funded company. Since many companies have multiple funding events, some have more than one circle. If you hover over a circle, it will display more info about the company related to it.</div> <br/> <!-- Start of SimpleHitCounter Code --> <div style="align: right; text-align: right; width: 100%; position: relative; height: 40px; top: 34px;"> <img src="http://simplehitcounter.com/hit.php?uid=1784225&f=255&b=16777215" border="0" height="18" width="83" alt="web counter" style="left: 13px;position: relative;"> <br> <a href="http://www.simplehitcounter.com" target="_blank" style="position: relative; top: -7px; font-size: 12pt; text-decoration: none; color: #666666;">Site Visits</a> </div> <!-- End of SimpleHitCounter Code --> </div> </div> <div id="AS3GraphicBox"> <div id="AS3SMButtons"> <table id="AS3SMTable"> <tr> <td id="AS3SMTwitterLogo"> <a class="AS3SMLink" href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Interactive+%23InfoGraph+%26+blog+on+1200%2B+%23BigData+fundings+via+%40Lampitos+%40Crunchbase+http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F1rUFfzR+https%3A%2F%2Ftwitter.com%2FTerry_Timko%2Fstatus%2F523101882219114496%2Fphoto%2F1&source=clicktotweet&related=clicktotweet" target="_blank"></a> </td> <td id="AS3SMFacebookLogo"> <a class="AS3SMLink" href="https://www.facebook.com/dantimko1" target="_blank"></a> </td> </tr> <tr> <td id="AS3SMGPlusLogo"> <a class="AS3SMLink" href="https://plus.google.com/101204322621276119637/posts" target="_blank"></a> </td> <td id="AS3SMYoutubeLogo"> <a class="AS3SMLink" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC99FKepOfAtjh0UoRGFfXDw" target="_blank"></a> </td> </tr> </table> </div> </div> </div>';

You can find that 1st effort <a href="http://tabsoft.co/1CnqZpB" target="_blank">here</a>. I found that first project useful, and I\'ve gotten a lot of positive feedback on it. In a way, that gig was the beginning of Project C.</div> <br/> <div>In Project C, I used Crunchbase\'s API to capture relevant data of over 85k companies and connect those companies to colleges based on which schools the founders attended. Once Project C was complete, I realized that the use cases were not limited to my original intention, so I decided to branch out.</div> <br/> <div>Crunchbase is an ever changing, curated and crowd sourced database of company descriptions, funding, acquisitions and in many cases their founders and executives. Data quality and sparseness was a big issue. I found over 900 different categories associated with the companies I looked at for Project C. Often categories were ambiguous, redundant, misspelled, or meaningless. Most companies had several categories, yet many had none. I chose to map each company to one of 30 "primary categories" based on a simple algorithm I scripted. This allowed me to categorize companies who did not have a Crunchbase category and put each company in a primary category for easier filtering.</div> <br/> <div>To model the Big Data ecosystem, I started with several lists of Big Data companies (Sand Hill 50, CIO BigData 100, ...) and used the category work and rough text analytics of Crunchbase\'s Short and Long descriptions to add relevant companies, creating what I named "The Curated Big Data Company List". Each company needed to be on a respected list, be generally known to my collaborators, or needed a Crunchbase description that set off multiple flags AND had > $1M in funding.</div> <br/> <div>Once I had the list I broke them down into 18 Big Data Categories based on Project C category mapping, Crunchbase categories, short and long descriptions of the companies, and knowledge of the space. Several of the categories have subcategories (i.e. Data Driven, Analytics & Consulting is broken down by segment/industry and Data Management Platform is broken down by SQL, NoSLQ, hybrid...) Work is still being done to flag companies whose primary delivery model is Cloud/aaS or who are</div> </div> <div id="AS14InfoBoxTextRight"> <div style="text-indent: 0px;">focused on the Internet of Things.</div> <ul> <li>Analytics (Asterdata, 1010Data, ...)</li> <li>Business Intelligence (Business Object, Domo, MicroStratgey, ...)</li> <li>Consulting/Services/SI (Accenture, Mu Sigma, ...)</li> <li>Data Discovery (Tableau, Datameer, Qliktech, LogiAnalytics, ...)</li> <li>Data Driven (Companies who use primarily data to drive business outcomes from Voltari to TRUECar and Flatiron Health to Opower)</li> <li>Data Integration (Informatica, Pentaho, Ab Initio, ...)</li> <li>Data Management Platform (Everything from Oracle to Cloudera and Hortonworks to Cloudant or Vertica)</li> <li>Data Provider/Exchange: (D&B, DataSift, Angie\'s List, Nielsen, the Climat Corporation, ...)</li> <li>Ecosystem Player (Amazon, Microsoft, IBM, HP, Google, ...)</li> <li>Geo/Location (DigitalGlobe, Loqate, ...)</li> <li>Governance (Kalido, Adaptive, ...)</li> <li>HW/Infrastructure (DataDirect, Fusion-IO, Intel, ...)</li> <li>Marketplace (Data marketplace)</li> <li>Open Data (Socrata, OpenGov, ...)</li> <li>Operational Intelligence (Splunk, New Relic, Loggly, ...)</li> <li>Search (Elasticsearch, Endeca, ...)</li> <li>Security (Gazzang, XA Secure, Vormetric, ...)</li> <li>Tools (CrowdFlower, ScaleArc, Typesafe, ...)</li> </ul> <div>Of the 85k+ companies, 1462 had "Big Data" somewhere in their Crunchbase category, short description, or long description. Just 644 used Business Intelligence or BI. 3,957 used Analytics, 80 mentioned Hadoop, 44 NoSQL, 154 Data Science, 303 Data Driven, 194 Data Mining and only 32 Open Data. In all, 4,162 companies had one or more of these tags out of the 73k with material data, which is 7% of the total.</div> <br/> <div>As you look at the data, its obvious that not all of the companies are part of the Big Data ecosystem. An ad placement firm that uses analytics is not in the Big Data system, but a company that aggregates and resells global ad data may very well be. I believe we have better than a 90% solution here.</div> <br/> <div>Clearly there are many different ways to view and explore this data. Poject C and Project BigData are just the tip of the iceberg! I hope you enjoyed this and found it useful. I welcome feedback at dantimko1@gmail.com, but I might not get back to you right away.

It is based on the work I did for Project C (which you see and can read about <a href="http://www.lampitosgames.com/?highlight=ProjectC">here</a>). The list of companies and their classification into categories is based on a dozen published sources and rough text analytics of the Crunchbase database. Crunchbase is a curated crowed sourced database of over 285k companies.</div> <br/> <div>As for the data, there are 645 public & private companies in the data set. From Teradata and IBM to Actuate & Zoomdata. I began by harvesting data from Crunchbase by using their free API w/ Python. As of September, Crunchbase had 1250 funding events for 410 of the companies on my list. I\'ve grouped these companies into 18 categories, allowing you to compare peers as well as trends across categories. Some of the categories are broken down further. For example, the tool allows you to differentiate between cloud-based and on premise solutions or SQL vs. NoSQL databases. I gathered additional data from a variety of sources. For example, LinkedIn was used to find the number of employees.</div> <br/> <div>How does this work? Based on the information gathered, I\'ve constructed a number of interactive graphs using Tableau that enables you to slice and dice the data in interesting and informative ways. Below, you can find treemaps to compare categories, geographic maps to see where companies are located, and bubble charts (which are</div> </div> <div id="AS3InfoBoxTextRight"> <div style="text-indent: 0px;">great to see relative size of large sets), and traditional line charts to compare different aspects of the data). With most of the graphs you can interact with the results by choosing different filters (category, location, when funding occurred, etc.)</div> <br/> <div>These tools allow you to explore the data across a variety of dimensions like how has funding changed over the years, or variances in geography, category, or stage of funding. It also allows you to ask questions...Where is the new (early stage) money going today vs. 3 or 5 years ago? (answer: Today Data Driven industry solutions, 5 years ago Platforms, Analytics & Data Discovery). You can also compare fundings by category, or how one funding event compares to other funding events in the same category. How does Datastax $106M round in September 2014 compare to funding of other Data Management Platforms in 2014?</div> <br/> <div>The first graph shows 1250 funding events. Each event is represented by a circle. The size of the circle depicts the amount of funding, while the color of the circle shows the category of the funded company. Since many companies have multiple funding events, some have more than one circle. If you hover over a circle, it will display more info about the company related to it.</div> <br/> <!-- Start of SimpleHitCounter Code --> <div style="align: right; text-align: right; width: 100%; position: relative; height: 40px; top: 34px;"> <img src="http://simplehitcounter.com/hit.php?uid=1784225&f=255&b=16777215" border="0" height="18" width="83" alt="web counter" style="left: 13px;position: relative;"> <br> <a href="http://www.simplehitcounter.com" target="_blank" style="position: relative; top: -7px; font-size: 12pt; text-decoration: none; color: #666666;">Site Visits</a> </div> <!-- End of SimpleHitCounter Code --> </div> </div> <div id="AS3GraphicBoxS"> <div id="AS3SMButtons"> <table id="AS3SMTable"> <tr> <td id="AS3SMTwitterLogo"> <a class="AS3SMLink" href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Interactive+%23InfoGraph+%26+blog+on+1200%2B+%23BigData+fundings+via+%40Lampitos+%40Crunchbase+http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F1rUFfzR+https%3A%2F%2Ftwitter.com%2FTerry_Timko%2Fstatus%2F523101882219114496%2Fphoto%2F1&source=clicktotweet&related=clicktotweet" target="_blank"></a> </td> <td id="AS3SMFacebookLogo"> <a class="AS3SMLink" href="https://www.facebook.com/dantimko1" target="_blank"></a> </td> </tr> <tr> <td id="AS3SMGPlusLogo"> <a class="AS3SMLink" href="https://plus.google.com/101204322621276119637/posts" target="_blank"></a> </td> <td id="AS3SMYoutubeLogo"> <a class="AS3SMLink" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC99FKepOfAtjh0UoRGFfXDw" target="_blank"></a> </td> </tr> </table> </div> </div> </div>';

After working with this for quite some time, I\'ve found some very interesting patterns.</div> <br/> <div>The first niche of my project that I want to expose is a comparison of fundings within revised categories where I filtered companies based on what they do. I also needed a better graph to showcase the differences between categories. The two graphs below provide examples of what can be accomplished with Tableau, lots of work, and the data set that I built.

You can fiddle with Tableau\'s sluggish web interface, but I would recommend downloading this project and working directly in Tableau if you are truly interested. It is like 10 times faster if you download the project.

Different industries have different centers of gravity. Banking is usually weighted toward New York, Tech weighted toward Bay Area, and BioTech weighted toward Minneapolis. While you\'d expect most of the Big Data companies to be based in the Bay Area, I found other cities that had a good share of companies, with cool patters to explore per category. So I made the following map for you to play with to make this information possible to visualize.</div> <br/> <div>The Crunchbase address data was surprisingly sparse and inaccurate. So I used the Google API to obtain the locations for most of the companies in the data set.</div> </div> <div id="AS9InfoBoxTextRightS"> <div>In this graph the size of the circle shows the total amount funding for any given company, and the color shows which category the company is in. The tool itself maps this data globally, but 85% of the companies listed in Crunchbase are based in the US. I suspect this is for 3 reasons: 1 - Crunchbase is US centric. 2 - Other countries funding models are different. 3 - Most of the investment is actually happening in the US.
